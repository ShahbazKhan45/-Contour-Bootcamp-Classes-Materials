<h2>How to Link Bootstrap</h2>
<h5>Method 1: Using the Bootstrap Content Delivery Network (CDN) <br> For CSS</h5>

        <link rel=”stylesheet”
            href=”https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css”rel=”nofollow”
            integrity=”sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm” crossorigin=”anonymous”>

        <h5>For JS</h5>
        <p>Copy this stylesheet before the end of the <body> tag of your desired HTML file. <br>
                <script src=”https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js”
                    integrity=”sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN”

        You can easily use the bootstrap through its class example is mentioned below:
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">Good Luck :)</div>
            </div>
        </div>
</p>



<h2>Containers</h2>
<p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. <br>
    Containers are used to <strong> contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content </strong> within them. <br>
    The w3-container class is the perfect class to use for all HTML container elements like: <br>
<div>, <article>, <section>, <header>, <footer>, <form>, and more</p>

<h2>Break Points</h2>                        
<p>CSS breakpoints are points where the website content responds according to the device width, <br> 
    allowing you to show the best possible layout to the user. CSS breakpoints are also called <br> 
    media query breakpoints, as they are used with media query</p>
                       
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Over a dozen reusable components built to provide iconography, dropdowns, input groups, navigation, alerts, and much more.</p>

<h2>Buttons</h2>                        
<p>Use Bootstrap's custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for multiple sizes, states, and more.</p>

<h1>Programming Fundamentals</h1>
<p>Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms</p>

<h2>Datatypes</h2>
<p>In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. <br> 
    The five most basic types of data are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Strings     ==> var a="Shahbaz Khan";</li>
    <li>Numbers     ==> let b = 7;</li>
    <li>Booleans    ==> let c = true;</li>
    <li>Undefined   ==> var d;</li>
    <li>Null <strong>In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist. <br> 
        Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.</strong> <br>
         ==> let person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
         person = null;</li>
    <li>Object      ==> let person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};</li>
</ul>
<h2>Arrays</h2>

                        
                        Loop
                        Function
                        Conditions


                        <h1>Java Script</h1>
                        Arrow
                        Clousure
                        Recursion
